🧩 Error message while fixing permissions in Eve-NG Environment after adding firmware images. 

ERROR: PHP Warning: file_get_contents (/opt/unetlab/platform/): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /opt/unetlab/html/includes/init.php on line 71   

📋 Description of the problem:
According to my research, this error means that the file_get_contents() function is attempting to read a directory as if it were a file.    
Specifically, line 71 of init.php is likely trying to read the contents of the /opt/unetlab/platform/ directory, which is not a file, and thus the operation fails.   

This issue happens - At least, for me, after uploaded the firmware image and run command for fixed permission.    
As you remember and may know, we fixed permission to make sure that the system has the right access to directories and files of EVE-NG,    
avoiding permissions issues that may prevent the start of execution of some functions. 

🛠️ Solution:
1. Open EVE-NG as usual on VMWare. - I suggest that, once you open EVE-NG on VMWare and logged in, open Putty and connect to the IP address shown before login. Ex.: 192.168.0.19.
2. Once you are login on Putty, run the following command -Right-click for paste:   
    dmesg | grep -i cpu | grep -i -e intel -e amd
      a. If the output contains "Intel", create the file and add "intel" to it: echo "intel" > /opt/unetlab/platform
      b. If the output contains "AMD", create the file and add "amd" to it: echo "amd" > /opt/unetlab/platform
3. After creating or modifying the platform file, run the permission fix command for EVE-NG: /opt/unetlab/wrappers/unl_wrapper -a fixpermissions

And should not give you the error anymore. I was able to fix permissions and work on my EVE-NG lab environment without any problems. 

If you have any other solution - Better than mine, let me know.    
Since I'm rookie on Ubuntu, I seach a LOT for having a faster solution and this one worked for me.
